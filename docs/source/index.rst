**dramatiq** is a distributed task processing library for Python with
a focus on simplicity, reliability and performance.

Here's what it looks like:

::

  import dramatiq
  import requests

  @dramatiq.actor
  def count_words(url):
     response = requests.get(url)
     count = len(response.text.split(" "))
     print(f"There are {count} words at {url!r}.")

  # Synchronously count the works on example.com in the current process
  count_words("http://example.com")

  # or send the actor a message so that it may perform the count
  # later, in a separate process.
  count_words.send("http://example.com")

**dramatiq** is :doc:`licensed<license>` under the AGPL and it
officially supports Python 3.6 and later.  :doc:`commercial`
is also available.
