    """Middleware that interrupts actors whose worker process has been
    signaled for termination.
    Currently, this is only available on CPython.

    Note:
      This works by setting an async exception in the worker thread
      that runs the actor.  This means that the exception will only get
      called the next time that thread acquires the GIL.  Concretely,
      this means that this middleware can't cancel system calls.

    Parameters:
      notify_shutdown(bool): When true, the actor will be interrupted
        if the worker process was terminated.
