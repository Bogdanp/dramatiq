^^^^^^^

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Typing support has been improved.  (`#482`_, `@staticdev`_)

.. _@FinnLidbetter: https://github.com/FinnLidbetter
.. _@nffdiogosilva: https://github.com/nffdiogosilva

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The ``watchdog`` library is no longer being pinned to a specific
  version.  (`#428`_)

  stack.  (`#433`_, `#434`_, `@ethervoid`_)

Fixed
^^^^^

  up.  (`#419`_, `#420`_, `@FinnLidbetter`_)

.. _#420: https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq/pull/420
.. _@FinnLidbetter: https://github.com/FinnLidbetter


`1.11.0`_ -- 2021-05-22
-----------------------

Added
^^^^^

* :meth:`decode<dramatiq.Message.decode>` now raises a new error,
  :class:`DecodeError<dramatiq.DecodeError>`, on exception. (`#375`_,
  `@thomazthz`_)

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The RabbitMQ broker moves messages that fail to decode to the
  DLQ. (`#375`_, `@thomazthz`_)

.. _#375: https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq/pull/375
.. _@thomazthz: https://github.com/thomazthz

Fixed
^^^^^

* The Redis broker is now more defensive in how it handles
  re-enqueueing messages.  This should fix a potential race condition
  where a worker could hit its heartbeat timeout but still end up
  re-enqueueing messages (thus ending up with the same message id
  enqueued multiple times).  (`#266`_, `#395`_)
* A code path that could lead to an unbound variable error has now
  been fixed.  (`#382`_)
* Deleting the connection off of a ``RabbitMQ`` broker now correctly
  closes it and its associated channel (if any) before removing it
  from the broker. (`#381`_, `#384`_)

.. _#266: https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq/issues/266
.. _#395: https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq/pull/395

.. _#384: https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq/issue/384

Added
^^^^^

* The RabbitMQ broker dead message TTL can now be configured via the
  ``dramatiq_dead_message_ttl`` environment variable.  (`#354`_,
  `@evstratbg`_)
* The CLI now supports referencing a callable to set up the broker on
  worker startup.  (`#350`_)
* The ``--worker-shutdown-timeout`` flag.  (`#330`_, `@mic47`_)

.. _#330: https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq/pull/330

.. _@mic47: https://github.com/mic47

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The CLI raises an error when the ``--watch`` flag is set on
  unsupported platforms. (`#326`_, `#328`_, `@CaselIT`_)

Fixed
^^^^^

* The CLI now returns code ``1`` when one of the workers is killed by
  an unhandled signal.  (`#334`_, `@omegacoleman`_)
* The results middleware now gracefully handles actor-not-found errors
  during nack. (`#336`_, `#337`_, `@AndreCimander`_)
* A memory bloat issue with tasks that raise exceptions.  (`#351`_)
* CI on Windows. (`#371`_, `@gdvalle`_)

`1.8.1`_ -- 2020-02-02
----------------------

Fixed
^^^^^

* An issue where an ``IndexError`` would be raised when multiple
  middlewre containing fork functions were defined.  (`#271`_)

.. _#271: https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq/issues/271

`1.8.0`_ -- 2020-02-02
----------------------

Added
^^^^^

* Support for forking and running arbitrary functions (so-called "fork
  functions").  (`#127`_, `#230`_)
* The ``--fork-function`` flag.
* The ``--skip-logging`` flag.  (`#263`_, `@whalesalad`_)

.. _#263: https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq/pull/263
.. _@whalesalad: https://github.com/whalesalad

Fixed
^^^^^

* An issue where the ``max_age`` parameter to |AgeLimit| was being
  ignored.  (`#240`_, `@evstratbg`_)
* An issue with delaying pipelines.  (`#264`_, `@synweap15`_)
* An issue where the master process would sometimes hang when stopped.
  (`#260`_, `@asavoy`_)
* An issue where the |RedisBroker| could sometimes prefetch more
  messages than it was configured to.  (`#262`_, `@benekastah`_)
* The |StubBroker| now flushes its dead letter queue when its
  ``flush_all`` method is called.  (`#247`_, `@CapedHero`_)
* The |RedisBroker| now takes the max lua stack size into account.
  This should fix certain heisenbugs that folks have encountered with
  that broker.  (`#259`_, `@benekastah`_)

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The |RabbitmqBroker| now creates its queues lazily.  (`#163`_, `#270`_, `@timdrijvers`_)
* The |Prometheus| middleware no longer depends on file locking to
  start its exposition server.  Instead, it uses the new fork
  functions functionality to start the server in a separate, unique
  process.  The middleware no longer takes any parameters.  While this
  would normally be a breaking change, it appears those parameters
  were previously ignored anyway.  (`#127`_, `#230`_)

  than warnings.  (`#221`_, `@th0th`_)

.. _@brownan: https://github.com/brownan


`1.4.3`_ -- 2019-01-08
----------------------

Fixed
^^^^^

* Changed license classifier to the correct license.  This is why you
  shouldn't publish changed before you've had coffee, folks!


`1.4.2`_ -- 2019-01-08
----------------------

Fixed
^^^^^

* License classifier in PyPI package.  There were no source code
  changes for this release.


`1.4.1`_ -- 2018-12-30
----------------------

Added
^^^^^

* Support for redis-py 3.x.  (`#142`_, `@maerteijn`_)

.. _#142: https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq/pull/142
.. _@maerteijn: https://github.com/maerteijn

* Log files now work under Windows.  (`#141`_, `@ryansm1`_)

`1.4.0`_ -- 2018-11-25
----------------------

Added
^^^^^

* |Barriers|.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* ``cli.main`` now takes an optional argument namespace so that users
  may define their own entrypoints. (`#140`_, `@maerteijn`_)
* Actor "message received" and "completed in x ms" log messages are
  now logged with the ``DEBUG`` level instead of ``INFO`` level.  This
  improves throughput and makes logging much less verbose.
* The |TimeLimit| middleware no longer uses signals to trigger time
  limit handling.  Instead it uses a background thread per worker
  process.
* Dramatiq now shuts itself down if any of the workers die
  unexpectedly (for example, if one of them is killed by the OOM
  killer).
* Windows is now supported (with some caveats)! (`#119`_, `@ryansm1`_)

Fixed
^^^^^

* Allow ``pipe_ignore`` option to be set at the actor level.  (`#100`_)

`1.3.0`_ -- 2018-07-05
----------------------

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Upgraded prometheus_client to 0.2.x.
* Bumped pika to version 0.12.  Because of this change, the
  ``interrupt`` method on |Broker| and its usages within |Worker| have
  been dropped.
* There is no longer a max message delay.

Fixed
^^^^^

* |Brokers| can now be passed an empty list of middleware.  (`#90`_)
* Potential stack overflow when restarting Consumer threads.  (`#89`_)

.. _#89: https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq/issues/89
.. _#90: https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq/issues/90


`1.2.0`_ -- 2018-05-24
----------------------

Added
^^^^^

* Support for worker heartbeats to |RedisBroker|.
* ``maintenance_chance`` and ``heartbeat_timeout`` parameters to
  |RedisBroker|.
* |Interrupt| base class for thread-interrupting exceptions. (`@rpkilby`_)

Changed
^^^^^^^

* |TimeLimitExceeded| is now a subclass of |Interrupt|.

Fixed
^^^^^

* |StubBroker_join| and |Worker_join| are now more reliable.
* Module import path is now prepended to search path rather than
  appended.  This fixes an issue where importing modules with the same
  name as modules from site-packages would end up importing the
  modules from site-packages. (`#88`_)
* |Prometheus| middleware no longer wipes the prometheus data
  directory on startup.  This fixes an issue with exporting
  application metrics along with worker metrics.

.. _#88: https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq/issues/88

Deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^

* ``requeue_{deadline,interval}`` parameters to |RedisBroker|.  These
  two parameters no longer have any effect.

* ``flush`` and ``flush_all`` methods to |RabbitmqBroker|.  (`#62`_)

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Cleaned up command line argument descriptions.

Deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^

* |URLRabbitmqBroker| is deprecated.  The |RabbitmqBroker| takes a
  ``url`` parameter so use that instead.  |URLRabbitmqBroker| will be
  removed in version 2.0.

Fixed
^^^^^

* ``rabbitmq`` and ``watch`` extra dependencies are only installed
  when they are explicitly required now.  (`#60`_, `@rpkilby`_)
* signal handling from the master process on FreeBSD 10.3.  (`#66`_)
* reloading now uses ``sys.executable`` when exec'ing workers that
  were started with ``python -m dramatiq``.
* an issue that caused logging to fail when non-utf-8 characters were
  printed to stdout/err.  (`#63`_)
* an issue with potentially drifting keys in the |WindowRateLimiter|.
  (`#69`_, `@gdvalle`_)
