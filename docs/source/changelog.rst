Changelog
=========

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.


`Unreleased`_
-------------

Added
^^^^^

* Support for running forking and running arbitrary functions
  (so-called "fork functions").  (`#127`_, `#230`_)
* The ``--fork-function`` flag.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The |Prometheus| middleware no longer depends on file locking to
  start its exposition server.  Instead, it uses the new fork
  functions functionality to start the server in a separate, unique
  process.  The middleware no longer takes any parameters.  While this
  would normally be a breaking change, it appears those parameters
  were previously ignored anyway.  (`#127`_, `#230`_)

`1.4.3`_ -- 2019-01-08
----------------------

Fixed
^^^^^

* Changed license classifier to the correct license.  This is why you
  shouldn't publish changed before you've had coffee, folks!


`1.4.2`_ -- 2019-01-08
----------------------

Fixed
^^^^^

* License classifier in PyPI package.  There were no source code
  changes for this release.


`1.4.1`_ -- 2018-12-30
----------------------

Added
^^^^^

* Support for redis-py 3.x.  (`#142`_, `@maerteijn`_)

.. _#142: https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq/pull/142
.. _@maerteijn: https://github.com/maerteijn

`1.4.0`_ -- 2018-11-25
----------------------

Added
^^^^^

* |Barriers|.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* ``cli.main`` now takes an optional argument namespace so that users
  may define their own entrypoints. (`#140`_, `@maerteijn`_)
* Actor "message received" and "completed in x ms" log messages are
  now logged with the ``DEBUG`` level instead of ``INFO`` level.  This
  improves throughput and makes logging much less verbose.
* The |TimeLimit| middleware no longer uses signals to trigger time
  limit handling.  Instead it uses a background thread per worker
  process.
* Dramatiq now shuts itself down if any of the workers die
  unexpectedly (for example, if one of them is killed by the OOM
  killer).
* Windows is now supported (with some caveats)! (`#119`_, `@ryansm1`_)

Fixed
^^^^^

* Allow ``pipe_ignore`` option to be set at the actor level.  (`#100`_)
* Result encoder now defaults to the global encoder.  (`#108`_, `@xdmiodz`_)
* Dot characters are now allowed in queue names. (`#111`_)
* Tests are now run on Windows. (`#113`_, `@ryansm1`_)

.. _@xdmiodz: https://github.com/xdmiodz


`1.3.0`_ -- 2018-07-05
----------------------

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Upgraded prometheus_client to 0.2.x.
* Bumped pika to version 0.12.  Because of this change, the
  ``interrupt`` method on |Broker| and its usages within |Worker| have
  been dropped.
* There is no longer a max message delay.

Fixed
^^^^^

* |Brokers| can now be passed an empty list of middleware.  (`#90`_)
* Potential stack overflow when restarting Consumer threads.  (`#89`_)

.. _#89: https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq/issues/89
.. _#90: https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq/issues/90


`1.2.0`_ -- 2018-05-24
----------------------

Added
^^^^^

* Support for worker heartbeats to |RedisBroker|.
* ``maintenance_chance`` and ``heartbeat_timeout`` parameters to
  |RedisBroker|.
* |Interrupt| base class for thread-interrupting exceptions. (`@rpkilby`_)
* |ShutdownNotifications| middleware. (`@rpkilby`_)

Changed
^^^^^^^

* |TimeLimitExceeded| is now a subclass of |Interrupt|.

Fixed
^^^^^

* |StubBroker_join| and |Worker_join| are now more reliable.
* Module import path is now prepended to search path rather than
  appended.  This fixes an issue where importing modules with the same
  name as modules from site-packages would end up importing the
  modules from site-packages. (`#88`_)
* |Prometheus| middleware no longer wipes the prometheus data
  directory on startup.  This fixes an issue with exporting
  application metrics along with worker metrics.

.. _#88: https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq/issues/88

Deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^

* ``requeue_{deadline,interval}`` parameters to |RedisBroker|.  These
  two parameters no longer have any effect.

.. _@rpkilby: https://github.com/rpkilby


`1.1.0`_ -- 2018-04-17

  parameters to |RedisBroker|.

* ``timeout`` parameter to all the brokers' ``join`` methods.  (`#57`_)
* ``flush`` and ``flush_all`` methods to |RedisBroker|.  (`#62`_)
* ``flush`` and ``flush_all`` methods to |RabbitmqBroker|.  (`#62`_)

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Cleaned up command line argument descriptions.

Deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^

* |URLRabbitmqBroker| is deprecated.  The |RabbitmqBroker| takes a
  ``url`` parameter so use that instead.  |URLRabbitmqBroker| will be
  removed in version 2.0.

Fixed
^^^^^

* ``rabbitmq`` and ``watch`` extra dependencies are only installed
  when they are explicitly required now.  (`#60`_, `@rpkilby`_)
* signal handling from the master process on FreeBSD 10.3.  (`#66`_)
* reloading now uses ``sys.executable`` when exec'ing workers that
  were started with ``python -m dramatiq``.
* an issue that caused logging to fail when non-utf-8 characters were
  printed to stdout/err.  (`#63`_)
* an issue with potentially drifting keys in the |WindowRateLimiter|.
  (`#69`_, `@gdvalle`_)

Changed
^^^^^^^

* |RateLimitExceeded| errors no longer log the full stack trace when
  raised within workers.
