class WindowRateLimiter(RateLimiter):
    """A rate limiter that ensures that only `limit` operations may
    happen over some sliding window.

    Note:

      Windows are in seconds rather that milliseconds.  This is
      different from most durations and intervals used in Remoulade,
      because keeping metadata at the millisecond level is far too
      expensive for most use cases.

    Parameters:
      backend(RateLimiterBackend): The backend to use.
      key(str): The key to rate limit on.
      limit(int): The maximum number of operations per window per key.
      window(int): The window size in *seconds*.  The wider the
        window, the more expensive it is to maintain.
    """
